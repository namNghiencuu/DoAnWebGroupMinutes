            Champions League elimination to Spurs will be put to one side for Pep Guardiola when the two teams tangle in
            the Premier League on Saturday lunchtime
            <br> <br>

            It tells you something about the standards upheld by Pep Guardiola and Manchester City that winning a
            domestic treble this season might well be seen
            as a little underwhelming.
            <br><br>

            Its just lifeÄù Pep said on Friday. It's football. [What's] important is how you behave. Football, life,
            they aren't easy. You have to fight and compete.
            Now, it's [about] how we react.
            <br><br>

            And have to accept these sorts of situations, but looking behind won‚Äôt help us move forwards. These kinds of
            players have an opportunity to show they can do that.
            <br><br>
            ‚ÄúThey will get back what they deserve. One day, maybe we will be in the same position, and maybe we will be
            more fortunate or precise ‚Äì or whatever ‚Äì to go through.‚Äù
